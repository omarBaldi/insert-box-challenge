# Front-end challenge

### Description

The purpose of this challenge is to let the user insert a new box as soon as the user clicks in between 2 boxes. If instead a box is clicked directly, the user will be able to edit the content.

### Consideration

The user will be prompted with an odd number of boxes, in order to let him click in between 2 of them to insert a new one.
